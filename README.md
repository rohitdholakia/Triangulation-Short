#Triangulation on Low-Resource Languages

This is a long paper accepted at [AMTA 2014](http://amta2014.amtaweb.org). The paper discusses the technique of [triangulation](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/Papers/acl07.pdf) (warning: pdf) and how the results change when applying it on low-resource languages. Traditionally, triangulation had been used to make translation for languages, with already significant amount of data (e.g French, Italian), even better. 

In our paper, we took a step back and considered languages (Haitian Creole, Malagasy, Maninkakan and Mawukakan) that are extremely low-resource. The questions we wanted to get an answer for were:

 * Will triangulation still work? 
 * Which one would work more? Phrase-table triangulation or something else? 
 * When the number of alternative translations are so low, which features can we add? Does it make a difference? 
 * A thorough analysis of what worked and what didn't. 
 
We have discussed the answers in the paper. 

#Remarks

It was great working on triangulation for Statistical Machine Translation. Low-Resource languages are great to work with because you get to see what happens when you are constrained w.r.t data. I would love to hear feedback on our work and feel free to reach out on the email address mentioned in the paper
