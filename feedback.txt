After the visit to IBM, here are some of the things that were asked/raised/objected to: 

0. Mainly, it was felt that Mawukakan was adding unfair advantage. I think that could be one of the reasons behind the rejection too. Somebody said that this is why, Europarl is good. So, either skip Mawukakan or make it fair. Having said that, just using triangulated table should help too, but that is not helping. 

1. It is not clear to people that this is Domain Adaptation. I am not sure if that is entirely our fault. It just takes a small while to get this clear. 

2. One person raised the question with the "IN + OUT" figure. Asked if there are that many "OUT" variables at play. I don't think I gave a great answer to this one. 

3. One person asked if we would have gotten the same result if we had only used 100k europarl, for example. 

4. there was a huge argument about why using Bible was "loose". Actually, one person said that using the Bible was "loose". So Salim objected to the usage of the word "loose". And then the things got very diverged after that, with no comments from me. 

5. It was not clear to a couple of people how the iterative method worked. 

6. Yes, I did get the comment, "This is just a Masters thesis"
